# SNAILS v2.0

assembly video: https://youtu.be/8Qm_oOv1cj8

SNAILS v2.0 works very similarly to the SNAILS v1.0 but with a much sleeker and efficient design. This design utilizes an upright Eppendorf pipette rather than the self-standing Ovation pipette to make it more accessible. It also is much more adaptable by being mobile and the gear ratio is easier to adjust.

The main difference is that the new design is intended to be mounted on an arm of some sort. This can be as simple as a ring stand clamp or as adaptable as a microphone/camera stand; whatever works for your application and budget.

## 3D printing
There is less 3D printing required for this design and fewer parts. There is also no need to use Lego parts like we suggested in v1.0.

## Circuitry
The circuitry is also more efficient and uses a Raspbery Pi Zero.
