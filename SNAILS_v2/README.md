# SNAILS v2.0

SNAILS v2.0 works very similarly to the SNAILS v1.0 but with a much sleeker and efficient design. This design utilizes an upright Eppendorf pipette rather than the self-standing Ovation pipette to make it more accessible. It also is much more adaptable by being mobile and the gear ratio is easier to adjust.
