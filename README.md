# SNAILS v1.0
Slow Nucleic Acid Instrument for Long Sequences

SNAILS is a 3D printed liquid handling robot. The STL files in this folder include all of the parts required to build the body of the robot. A raspberry pi, motor driver, motor, and standup pipette are also required for the full assembly as described in our paper.

## Printing Instructions
We used Ultimaker 3, S3, and S5 3D printers with the Ultimaker Cura program (https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura). We recommend PLA for the printing material with the point set to 0.2 mm and infil at 20% for all the pieces. For the base, motor holder, and bridge, support material needs to be included, and changing the support density to 25 for a smoother print job. Additionally, we recommend that the base is printed on a separate build plate than the other pieces because it is so much thinner and by separating the pieces you increase the chances of a successful print job.

## Assembling
Once the 3D printing is complete, all of the support material must be removed and all of the pieces should be able to snap together. Due to the margin or error from an Ultimaker, it possible some of the pieces will need to be slightly shaved down with a dremel to fully remove the border support material. Regardless, the pieces intentionally are designed to fit tightly together to avoid moving while running so light taps from a mallet can help to make the joints fully flush.
