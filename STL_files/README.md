# STL Files

These STL files are 3D object files that can be used to 3D print all the SNAILS parts. Printing instructions are on the main SNAILS page.

## Gears and Axles
All geare and axle STL files are provided. We recommend using the cap.gear.axle assembly over printing each part individually for the axle above the pipette. The 3D printed gears and axles will work; however, depending on the quality of your 3D printer, they may not be as accurate or durable as desired. Therefore, we recommend using Lego gears and axles for everything except the axle above the pipette (use the cap.gear.axle assembly) and the gear that fits over the motor. You can use a combination of 3D printed gears and Lego gears, as they are designed to fit together.
